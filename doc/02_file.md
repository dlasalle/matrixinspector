```

## Viewing a Matrix

To zoom in on the matrix, use the scroll wheel.
You can click and drag on the matrix to move it around.
Black pixels represent areas of the matrix where there are no non-zeros.
Pixels that are blue through white represent the presence of non-zeros, with
dark blue being the lowest density and white being the highest density.
